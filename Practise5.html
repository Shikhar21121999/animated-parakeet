	<p class="paragraph"> A portfolio is a grouping of 
		<span class="Highlight">
		financial assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies and cash equivalents, as well as their fund counterparts, including mutual, exchange-traded and closed funds.</span>
		 A portfolio can also consist of non-publicly tradable securities, like real estate, art, and private investments.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">A professional portfolio provides potential employers with a complete picture of a job candidate's abilities.
		<span class="Highlight">
	 	A professional portfolio should include your experience, accomplishments, skills, education, interests, and professional goals and objectives. 
	 	</span>
	Portfolios are different from resumes or cover letters and provide information that might be just what you need to edge out the competition. </p>
